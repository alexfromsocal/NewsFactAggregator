cawf1	"Emergency crews extinguished a fire burning dangerously close to a Chevron underground natural gas pipeline Thursday and lifted an evacuation order that had forced some 4,000 residents from their homes the night before. Contra Costa County Deputy Fire Chief Lewis Broschard told reporters that all evacuation orders were lifted as of 2:30 p.m. Thursday, about 15 hours after some 1,400 homes were evacuated near the city of Bay Point. Broschard said officials decided quickly to issue evacuations ""so we could get people out of harm's way if there were to be a big explosion."" VIDEO: The attack unfolded at about 9:30 p.m. Sunday, when 18-year-old Nia Wilson was stabbed to death on a platform at the MacArthur BART Station. Her sister, 26-year-old Letifah Wilson, was wounded. At a news conference Thursday, officials hailed the operation a success, saying there were no injuries to residents or safety workers and no homes were damaged. The underground fire began Wednesday night inside a Chevron natural gas pipeline vault, where workers access pipeline valves, about an hour after a fire crew had been called to the area and extinguished a nearby grass fire, said Terence Carey, an assistant fire chief for the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District. Chevron emergency crews spent the night purging natural gas from the pipeline and then injected nitrogen to extinguish any remaining fire in the vault, Carey said. Once that operation was complete, fire and Chevron officials inspected the vault to make sure there was no remaining danger so people could return home. Carey said the vault was about 10-12 feet (3-4 meters) wide and 8 feet (2.5 meters) deep. He said Chevron officials were inspecting damage and would determine what repairs need to be made. He said he could not comment on potential disruption of services and referred questions to Chevron. Chevron officials did not respond to repeated questions sent by email asking for details on gas disruptions to the area and how many people would be affected. It was not clear if the grass fire caused the fire inside the pipeline vault, which Carey said was one of several questions under investigation. KTVU-TV reported that many people slept in their parked cars at a light rail station while others parked and slept in outdoor parking lots. Evacuation centers were opened Thursday. In 2010, a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. natural gas pipeline exploded in San Bruno, south of San Francisco, killing eight people and destroying 38 homes. The utility was subsequently convicted by a federal court for violating pipeline safety regulations and fined $1.6 billion."	2018-10-18
cawf2	"After the Tubbs fire destroyed his home, Will Abrams’ son read a book about the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. He learned that after the catastrophic blaze, the city required all new buildings to be constructed with fireproof materials like brick and stone. “Is our new house going to be made out of brick, Dad?” 10-year-old Leo asked his father. If this notion — to rebuild with careful intent after a fire — is obvious to a child, it should be to wine country officials, Abrams recalls thinking. If only it were that simple, officials say. One year after 5,500 Sonoma County homes were lost in California’s most destructive wildfire in recorded history, civil servants are balancing the threat of future disaster with an immediate and dire need for housing. So far, they have prioritized dwellings, clearing the way for residents to rebuild quickly. Little — if anything — has been done to strengthen building codes or zoning ordinances, which could lead to burdensome expenses for both cash-strapped residents and local government. “In California, we make that calculation every time we build,” said Santa Rosa Mayor Chris Coursey. “We don’t stop people from building because we live in an area with natural risks.” In fact, officials have made rebuilding as simple as possible in a county that was facing a serious housing shortage even before the fire. In Santa Rosa — which bore the brunt of the fire’s wrath — most construction permits are now approved within a few days. As of early October, more than 1,200 of the 2,700 homes lost in Santa Rosa were being rebuilt, most of them on the same properties that were engulfed in flames just a year before. One year after California's most devastating wildfire, Santa Rosa is a patchwork of loss and renewal. There are no plans to impose zoning ordinances that might restrict building in the county’s most fire-prone areas, said David Guhin, Santa Rosa’s assistant city manager. That could change when the city reviews its general plan in the coming months, Guhin said. But that is unlikely. Santa Rosa drafted its first general plan shortly after the 1964 Hanly fire, which carved a path of destruction nearly identical to the Tubbs fire. It urged developers to consider earthquakes and floods as they built, but not wildfires. The current plan doesn’t either. “We can’t tell someone where to rebuild their house,” Guhin said. “We can only make sure they’re built in a much more resilient way.” Many of them will be, thanks to California’s most recent building codes, which are some of the toughest in the country. Any home built since 2008 in the wildland-urban interface — where structures mingle with flammable vegetation — must follow strict fire-retardant standards, including mesh coverings on attic vents and double-paned windows. Sprinkler systems are now required in all new homes. “We’ve held everyone to those current standards,” said Sonoma County Supervisor James Gore. “But we also haven’t added any.” The county has instead focused on strengthening its emergency alert system. During the Tubbs fire, alerts reached only a fraction of those in the path of the blaze. The county has also launched a curbside chipper program, intended to help residents create defensible space — the 100-foot buffer between a structure and vegetation — around their homes. A county-sponsored marketing campaign encourages property owners to clear flammable plants from their land and harden their houses. But fire safety experts say that mere encouragement isn’t enough. The county should consider enforcing strengthened building and landscaping regulations, especially in neighborhoods that aren’t flagged as fire hazard zones but could ultimately succumb to an unpredictable weather event like the Tubbs firestorm, said Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist at UC Santa Barbara. Take, for example, Coffey Park, which lost more than 1,300 homes in the blaze, but is not in the wildland-urban interface. “As a researcher, I see lots of strong evidence supporting the idea that we should have more science-based regulatory constraints on how we build,” Moritz said. “Yet we shy away from that.” When Sonoma County officials argue against stricter building regulations, some note that many of the homes built to the county’s strictest codes were still destroyed in the Tubbs fire. The other argument? Money. Tougher codes would tack on tens-of-thousands of dollars to already expensive projects in middle-income neighborhoods like Coffey Park. And enforcing those standards requires resources the county just doesn’t have, Gore said. This funding shortfall is a problem most local governments confront after disasters, said Michele Steinberg, wildfire division director for the National Fire Prevention Assn. “You can put whatever you want in a code or a standard,” Steinberg said. “If you can’t enforce it, it’s worthless.” Some residents are pushing officials to explore less expensive ways to make the area more resilient. Abrams, who lost his home and is now the block captain for a fire-recovery neighborhood group, may be the most vocal among them. The 47-year-old has proposed a financial incentive program for those who meet certain fire-safe landscaping and building requirements. Gore, the supervisor, said that such a program may be in the works. The county has applied for a $6.5-million FEMA grant that would help residents fire-harden their homes, similar to earthquake retrofitting incentive programs. Abrams has also suggested county officials provide financial incentives to large private landholders like ranchers, vintners and golf courses owners who build fire breaks around their properties, and to develop tools that track progress toward enhanced community safety. Abrams, a tech entrepreneur, left New York for Sonoma County a few years ago because he craved the balance of quaint urbanity and nature that the area offers. Even so, Abrams and his wife, Eki, considered moving after the fire. But they chose to stick around; they wanted to show their 10-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter how to advocate for a more resilient community. “Our kids are not going to have a choice — they’ll have to join together to fight these climate change issues,” Abrams said. “I want them to see it in action, and learn from it, and be better prepared to deal with it.”"	2018-10-18
cawf3	"California is enduring another grueling wildfire season. But California fire experts say that wildfire season is a near-outdated term, and dangerous fires can happen anytime now. A Weather Channel simulation shows how a warmer planet is fueling the aggressive, persistent flames. It's shaping up to be another record-breaking year of wildfires in California. As of October 20, more than 7,100 fires have burned a combined total of more than 1.5 million acres across the state, the National Interagency Fire Center reports. The state also set a new record for its largest single wildfire to date when the Ranch Fire burned through 410,203 acres this fall. This is not an anomaly. In recent years, warmer temperatures across the western US have fueled more destructive flames than the region has ever seen. The 2017 fire season, which scorched vines across California wine country, was the costliest to date, triggering over $9.4 billion in losses in that state. The flames aren't even limited to a special season these days. ""We're responding to wildland fires year round now,"" Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean recently told the Sacramento Bee. A breathtaking video featuring Weather Channel Meteorologist Stephanie Abrams shows us why that's the case: it's all about heat. ""Over the past few decades the climate over the western US has become more conducive for wildfires with overall warmer, drier weather,"" Abrams said, as a simulation of dry, hot, overgrown brush heated up behind her, providing the perfect tinder for explosive and deadly flames. In a warmer world, there's ""plenty of available fuel to burn,"" she added. Take a look at how the flames develop more quickly and spread with vigor in warmer, drier weather: Large wildfires burn twice the area now that they did in 1970, as Abrams noted in the clip. This is not a trend that's expected to get any better if we continue with business as usual. California's 2018 Climate Change Assessment report estimates that the average area that wildfires burn will increase 77% by 2100, if we continue burning emissions from fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and oil that warm the atmosphere. Temperatures across the western US are expected to remain above average through November, according to the latest federal climate reports. Large swaths of California are also looking really dry right now, providing the perfect kindling for sparking tough-to-contain fires. ""We're in uncharted territory,"" California Governor Jerry Brown said earlier this year. ""Since civilization emerged 10,000 years ago, we haven't had this kind of heat condition, and it's going to continue getting worse. That's the way it is."""	2018-10-20
cawf4	"(Reuters) - A fire near a Chevron Corp natural gas pipeline in Pittsburg, California, has been put out after prompting the shutdown of the line and the evacuation of about 4,000 people, fire officials said on Thursday. “At around 8 p.m. PDT on Wednesday, Chevron Pipe Line Company (CPL) was notified of a fire caused by an electrical power line falling which started a fire near our valve junction on the Northern California Gas Line,” Chevron said in a statement. The Contra Costa County Fire Protection District announced at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday that the evacuation order due to the incident had been lifted. “Residents are free to return to their homes as they wish. All danger has passed,” it said on Twitter. About 4,000 people from 1,400 houses were evacuated within a half-mile range of the fire, Steve Hill, a spokesman for the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District, said. He added that while the fire was relatively small, the real problem was that it was burning inside a vault, very close to the 12-inch natural gas pipeline. Ryan Bain, another spokesman for the fire protection district, later said the fire had been extinguished."	2018-10-18

While this will not be an extreme Santa Ana event, gusts between 35 and 45 mph are possible in some of the northeast- to southwest-orientated canyons and passes. Winds are forecast to average 10-20 mph elsewhere, except for the immediate Los Angeles basin, where winds will be significantly less strong. Static Fire Danger. While Friday brought the strongest winds of the event, enough of a breeze will persist to keep the fire risk elevated through much of the weekend in the canyons and over the passes. It has been nearly a week since the last significant rainfall. Brush has once again reached a critically dry stage. The winds will help to boost temperatures over the region. Highs are forecast to be well into the 80s F each day. A few locations may flirt with 90. The warmth will help to lower humidity levels, which will also boost the fire threat. ""People should use extreme caution with open flames and outdoor power equipment,"" according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Evan Duffey.""Never toss a burning cigarette on the ground. Even the breeze generated by passing vehicles can be enough to ignite a wildfire. Avoid driving over and parking on high brush. The hot exhaust system can also spark a fire,"" Duffey said. The gusty winds can also kick up dust, which can temporarily blind some motorists. Proceed with extreme caution under those conditions. Farther to the east, a pocket of moisture will become trapped over part of the Great Basin this weekend. This moisture will produce a fair amount of clouds and cause spotty showers and thunderstorms over portions of Arizona, Utah and Nevada on Saturday and Sunday. People spending time outdoors or on the road across the interior Southwest may face some interruptions and delays as a result. Meanwhile, a pair of budding tropical features off the southwest coast of Mexico over the Pacific are not expected to move far enough to the north to bring rain to most of the region.

cawf9	"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday rekindled his criticism of California’s wildfire prevention steps and threatened to withhold billions of dollars of federal funding amid one of the most destructive fire seasons on record. “It’s hurting our budget, it’s hurting our country and they better get their act together,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting about California’s forestry management. He did not specify the type of funding that could be withheld. The Republican president’s comments, which followed his criticism in August of California’s wildfire prevention efforts, were aimed at Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, whom he has frequently criticized over immigration and other policies. With wildfires having charred nearly 2.8 million acres (1.1 million hectares) over the past two years in California, Trump said the state should do more to remove rotten trees and other debris that fuel fires. Brown’s press secretary, Evan Westrup, cited several fire prevention steps the governor had taken, including last month’s law requiring utilities to have fire prevention plans, and an order doubling to 500,000 acres (202,340 hectares) the land open to vegetation thinning. “The president’s comments are about as credible as his self-proclaimed ‘natural instinct for science,’” Westrup said in an email, referring to Trump’s self-assessment in an Associated Press interview this week. SIX-YEAR DROUGHT The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CalFire, noted that in the past two years of intense wildfires, the amount of federally managed forest land in California burned exceeded the amount of charred state forest land by 1.49 million acres (603,000 hectares) to 1.13 million acres (457,000 hectares), A six-year drought is mainly blamed for killing an estimated 129 million trees in state forests and CalFire has crews of 60 workers clearing debris every day, spokesman Scott McLean said by telephone. This week, California’s largest public utility cut off power to about 60,000 customers for up to two days in a fire prevention move when high winds threatened to topple trees and power lines. In August, Trump tweeted that unspecified water diversions to the Pacific Ocean were making California wildfires harder to fight. California had plenty of water to fight the blazes and the fires are primarily fought by crews hacking away at dry brush with hand tools and bulldozers, not with water, McLean said at the time."	2018-10-18

cawf11	"A year after the most destructive wildfire in California history blackened wine country, PG&E completed the first big test of its new better-safe-than-sorry strategy. As a last resort during extreme fire conditions, the utility is temporarily cutting off power to customers prevent its lines from sparking fires that turn into deadly infernos. While the recent power outages went mostly as planned and no major blazes broke out, there’s clearly room for improvement, as well as some big questions. One is: Did PG&E jump the gun? Perhaps. Cal Fire made clear it wasn’t involved in the shutoff and would only ask the utility to make such a decision to protect firefighters during an active fire. Customers have complained about spoiled food, lost business, closed schools and other interruptions to daily life. Some consumer groups are urging the California Public Utilities Commission to investigate. Also high on the list of questions: Is there a way to improve communication? PG&E said it started notifying customers late Saturday before cutting the power Sunday to about 59,000 households in six counties in the Sierra foothills and North Bay: El Dorado, Calaveras, Amador, Napa and Lake, Sonoma. Power was restored to the final 1,600 customers by 9 p.m. Tuesday. Under its Public Safety Power Shutoff policy enacted in September, PG&E notified emergency response agencies, first responders and local governments first. The utility also gave customers advance notice by phone, text and email, as well as alerts via social media and the news media. Notification, we’ve learned, is even more important when a lack of power could be a matter of life or death. PG&E’s policy is to make direct outreach to hospitals, fire stations, water agencies, telecommunications companies and others that provide “critical” services. The utility’s plan also calls for contacting residential customers enrolled in its medical financial assistance program, including 109,000 statewide who depend on life-support equipment, to urge them to check their backup generators or consider staying with friends or relatives. And, in this power shutoff, the utility says it sent employees to knock on doors if it wasn’t able to contact these customers through phone calls, texts or emails.But in Calistoga, officials still had to transport at least one resident to the hospital because a home oxygen machine was put out of commission, Fire Chief Steve Campbell told The Bee. That’s a problem. PG&E says while it will try to turn the power back on within 24 hours after the danger has passed, the outages can — and did — last two to five days. Much of the delay is to inspect power lines that are de-energized — in this case more than 78 miles of transmission lines and 2,150 miles of distribution lines. PG&E says some of its lines were damaged by high winds. Expect more of this. PG&E plans to do a “full assessment” of this shutoff, but anticipates at least one or two a year going forward, most likely in highest fire-risk areas. According to a map adopted this year by the CPUC, these areas include swaths of the Sierra and foothills, the North Bay and Southern California. The new power shutoff policy is only one part of a broader Community Wildfire Safety Program put together by PG&E after the devastation and near financial ruin from the October 2017 fires in wine country and the Sacramento Valley that killed 44 people. Officials have blamed PG&E for 16 of those fires so far, plus the June fires north of the Bay and the Cascade Fire in Yuba County in October that killed four.  PG&E, which has 5.3 million customers in its 70,000-square-mile service area, has opened a new 24-hour wildfire safety operations center, which uses real-time information from field teams, an expanded network of weather stations, live video streams and reports from national, state and local agencies. In the short term, it is focusing on meeting new state safety standards, including creating more space between trees and about 7,100 miles of overhead power lines in communities with the most extreme fire threat. Longer-term, it plans to “harden” its electrical network by replacing wood power poles with non-wood ones and installing stronger, coated power lines. The details and costs are still being worked out; some specifics will be in its 2020 general rate case, to be filed with the CPUC by the end of this year.  These measures will improve safety, but also will lower PG&E’s liability. After an intense lobbying campaign, Gov. Jerry Brown and legislators agreed to an 11th hour deal to change the state law that makes utilities responsible for paying damages if their equipment starts a fire, even if they are not negligent. Going forward, PG&E and other utilities will pay for damages based on their level of negligence, as determined by the CPUC. The deal also allows PG&E to charge its customers to finance long-term bonds to help cover the estimated $15 billion in damages from the wine country fires. The utility estimates that, for every $1 billion in bonds issued, its average residential customer will pay $5 a year more. That raises another question about these planned outages: Will customers will get a rebate for the inconvenience of losing power or be reimbursed for any losses? The answer is no, although customers won’t be billed for service during the outage, itself, since no electricity was used.  PG&E’s safety power shutoffs can be a step forward, if they’re done right. Yet even in the “new normal” on wildfires, corporations can’t escape responsibility to taxpayers and their customers."	2018-10-18

cawf13	"SAN DIEGO (NEWS 8) – A red flag warning will be in effect from 3 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday for San Diego County mountains and inland valleys as Santa Ana winds make a return to the region – combining low humidity levels and warm temperatures to create the potential for dangerous, wind-driven wildfires. This week, the president of the United States expressed his dissatisfaction with how fire crews across California are keeping people and property safe – threatening to cut billions in federal fire aid. The president’s criticism of fire prevention has sparked a heated response from firefighters. “It is very divisive. It is not productive at all, and we are choosing not to focus on that. We are choosing to focus on all the work that is getting done,” said Ken Pimlott, Cal Fire Director. In his criticism, the president claimed California should do more to remove decaying trees that provide fuel for wildfire and echoed his threat to cut billions in federal fire aid unless the state cleans up its forests. “Old trees are sitting there rotting and dry. Instead of cleaning them up, they don’t touch them. I would say to the governor or whoever will governor, get your act together.” The president’s comments left Pimlott puzzled. “None of it is accurate. It is just an uninformed decision of what is going on.” Pimlott further pointed out that over half of California’s forests are federally owned public lands. “The publicly owned forest lands are actually more overstocked than the privately forested land. So, at the end of the day, a lot of work still needs to be done on public lands.” Governor Jerry Brown recently stepped up the state’s fire prevention measures – doubling to 500,000 acres the land open to vegetation thinning. Brown also committed one-billion-dollars over the next five years to forest management and fire prevention. Locally, as San Diego County enters a red flag warning heading into the weekend, Cal Fire urged residents to have an evacuation plan in place and to pay close attention to fire officials. “We need to treat this warning no different than tornado warnings in the Midwest or hurricane warnings on the East Coast,” said Pimlott. San Diego County residents are also urged to avoid outdoor burning during the warning."	2018-10-19
cawf14	"President Trump generates a lot of smoke when he talks about fire. While California’s summer wildfires burned, he perplexed people across the spectrum by accusing lefty environmentalists of withholding water from firefighters. Now he’s charging lefty environmentalists with protecting the trees that fuel the blazes — and threatening to cut federal funds if state officials don’t “get their act together and clean up their forests.” Give the president credit for shifting to a slightly more believable story. Unlike his fantasy about water rationing for firefighters, Trump’s latest contribution contains embers of truth. But it’s still fundamentally false. While exurban sprawl and a warming climate play important roles, forest mismanagement is an acknowledged factor in the growing risk of wildfire throughout the West. This is less about tree-hugging than, ironically, firefighting: By suppressing the natural cycle of forest fires, we’ve allowed vegetation to grow until fires are more catastrophic when they do happen. Addressing this requires clearing undergrowth by controlled burns and other means, not just chopping down the big trees that environmentalists and loggers fight over. Nor do those interests fight as much as they used to in California, having come to more agreement that thinning can be good for forests, industry and residents. Hence the state’s Democratic government has been augmenting forest management funds even as the administration has been proposing cuts. What’s especially absurd about Trump’s latest fulmination is that much of this is up to him: The federal government manages about 46 percent of California’s land and more than 60 percent of the acreage that burned in 2016. But such facts are irrelevant to a president who is only looking to fan partisan flames."	2018-10-20
cawf15	"Some residents in Alpine feel state and federal authorities could be a doing a better job clearing forests of brush in order to prevent future wildfires. “It’s a big deal,"" Julie Munoz said. ""It’s a big fear,”  “I think they’re doing a horrible job managing the land,” Steven Ritter said. The comments come in light of remarks made by President Donald Trump this week. He blamed wildfires on California forest policy and threatened to withhold funding from the state. The President never specified what that funding would be. Cal Fire, the state's fire protection agency, disputes the president's claims about California's forest management plans, saying it does not know what Trump was referring to. ""Cal Fire has historically utilized every resource possible to focus on reducing wildfire risk through prescribed burning, fuel reduction, and forest health,"" the department's deputy director Michael Mohler said in a statement to NBC 7. ""We are proud to say that Cal Fire is the leader in forest management on the West Coast and we will continue to expand on this extremely important mission."" But it raised a point of concern for longtime residents in fire-prone areas of San Diego’s east county. Munoz has owned a home that is on Cleveland National Forest property for 18-years. She’s watched brush in the surrounding area grow out of control. ""I just think it needs to be controlled more. There's a lot of dry brush out here,"" she said. ""I see how they're clearing paths off the freeway, they're clearing all the brush away from there, but there's so much brush out here that needs to be done here too."" For Ritter, also owns a home on Cleveland National Forest property, the discussion has extra meaning. He lost a home during the 2012 Shockey Fire. Through Oct. 14 of this year, Cal Fire has responded to more than 5,300 fires and more than 620,000 acres have burned. Could that number drop if wild lands were better managed? “California definitely needs to do a better job, it's very apparent,"" Ritter said. ""We have more fires burning here than anywhere else in the whole country,"" Munoz agreed. “I mean, our firefighters work their behinds off,"" she said. ""They're hard workers and I know they do a good job of putting them out, but they shouldn't have to put so many fires out.""  Cal Fire said it is proactively awarding grants to local communities to reduce dry brush and fuels and for forest health projects throughout the state. ""Furthermore, looking towards the future, Cal Fire is implementing 6 hand crews to work year round on these efforts. These are just some of the examples of programs that we will continue to foster."" Moler said. ""However, we understand that participation from many agencies and the public is vital to maintaining forest health and fuel reduction so it is our top priority that we offer as much of our resources as we have available to work towards the common goal of reducing wildfire risk."""	2018-10-18
